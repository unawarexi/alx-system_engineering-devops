# API

## What Bash scripting should not be used for
- Bash scripting is not suitable for resource-intensive tasks, complex algorithms, or large-scale software development. 
- It's primarily designed for automating system tasks, file manipulation, and simple scripting tasks.

## What is an API
API stands for Application Programming Interface. 
- It is a set of rules and tools that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. 
- APIs define the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.

## What is a REST API
REST API (Representational State Transfer) is a type of web API that adheres to the principles of REST. 
- It uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for communication and typically returns data in JSON format. 
- RESTful APIs are designed to be scalable, stateless, and loosely coupled.

## What are microservices
Microservices is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, independent, and loosely coupled services. 
- Each service represents a specific business capability and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

## What is the CSV format
CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is a plain text file format used for representing tabular data.
- Each line of the file is a data record, and fields are separated by commas (or other delimiters). 
- It is commonly used for data exchange between applications.

## What is the JSON format
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format. 
- It is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. 
- JSON is often used to transmit data between a server and a web application, as an alternative to XML.

## Pythonic Package and module name style

## Pythonic Class name style
Class names should follow the CapWords or CamelCase convention, where the first letter of each word is capitalized.

## Pythonic Variable name style
Variable names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores for improved readability.

## Pythonic Function name style
Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores.

Constants (variables that should not be modified) should be in all uppercase, with words separated by underscores.

## Significance of CapWords or CamelCase in Python
CapWords or CamelCase is used in Python for class names to distinguish them from functions and variables.
- It follows a convention that helps improve code readability and maintainability.
