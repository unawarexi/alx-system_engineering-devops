# Web Stack Debugging Postmortem

## Issue Summary

**Duration:**  
Start Time: [Datetime] [Timezone]  
End Time: [Datetime] [Timezone]

**Impact:**  
- The web application experienced intermittent performance issues for approximately 2 hours.
- Users faced slow response times during the outage.
- Approximately 15% of users were affected.

**Root Cause:**  
The root cause of the issue was identified as a misconfiguration in the Puppet code responsible for fixing bad file extensions in the WordPress configuration.

## Timeline

- **Detection Time:** [Datetime] [Timezone]
- **How Detected:** The issue was initially detected through user reports of slow website performance. Subsequently, the operations team received monitoring alerts indicating increased response times.

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Investigated web server logs and identified a surge in 5xx HTTP error codes.
  - Noticed a recent deployment of Puppet code to fix file extensions and suspected it might be the cause.
  - Executed additional commands to inspect the state of the `wp-settings.php` file.

- **Misleading Paths:**
  - Initially explored potential database performance issues.
  - Investigated network latency but found no significant issues.

- **Escalation:**
  - The incident was escalated to the DevOps team responsible for Puppet configurations.
  - Communication was established with the development team to understand recent code changes.

- **Resolution:**
  - Reverted the recent Puppet deployment to the last known stable version.
  - Applied a hotfix to the Puppet code to correctly handle file extensions.
  - Monitored the web server logs to ensure errors subsided.

## Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause:**
- The issue originated from a misconfiguration in the Puppet code, causing incorrect replacements in the `wp-settings.php` file.

**Resolution:**
- The issue was resolved by reverting to a stable Puppet deployment and applying a hotfix to ensure proper replacement of file extensions.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements/Fixes:**
- Enhance testing procedures for Puppet code deployments to catch misconfigurations before reaching production.
- Implement stricter code review practices for changes related to critical configuration files.

**Tasks:**
1. Conduct a thorough review of the Puppet codebase to identify potential vulnerabilities.
2. Implement automated tests for Puppet configurations to prevent misconfigurations.
3. Enhance monitoring for web server logs to detect performance issues early.
4. Update the incident response plan to include specific steps for Puppet-related issues.

## Conclusion

This postmortem outlines the duration, impact, root cause, timeline of events, and corrective/preventative measures taken during the web stack debugging process. It serves as a valuable resource for improving our deployment processes and maintaining the stability of our web application.
