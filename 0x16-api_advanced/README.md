## How to read API documentation to find the endpoints youâ€™re looking for

To find the endpoints in an API documentation:

1. Look for a section titled "Endpoints" or "API Reference."
2. Understand the structure of the API, including base URL and available paths.
3. Pay attention to HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) associated with each endpoint.
4. Review parameters, request/response examples, and authentication requirements.

## How to use an API with pagination

When dealing with API pagination:

1. Check the API documentation for information on pagination parameters (e.g., `page`, `limit`).
2. Make initial requests with pagination parameters to retrieve a subset of data.
3. Look for response headers indicating the total number of pages or items.
4. Use subsequent requests to navigate through paginated results until all data is retrieved.

## How to parse JSON results from an API

To parse JSON results from an API:

1. Use a programming language that supports JSON (e.g., Python, JavaScript).
2. Extract data using key-value pairs from the JSON response.
3. Handle nested structures by navigating through the JSON hierarchy.
4. Utilize JSON parsing libraries or functions provided by your programming language.

## How to make a recursive API call

For making recursive API calls:

1. Identify the condition for recursion (e.g., paginated results, related resources).
2. Write a function to make API calls and process the data.
3. Include a base case to stop the recursion when the condition is met.
4. Make recursive calls within the function to continue processing additional data.

## How to sort a dictionary by value

To sort a dictionary by value:

1. Use a sorting function or method available in your programming language.
2. Convert the dictionary items into a list of tuples.
3. Apply the sorting function based on the desired sorting criteria (e.g., value).
4. Retrieve the sorted results, which can be a sorted list or a new dictionary.
