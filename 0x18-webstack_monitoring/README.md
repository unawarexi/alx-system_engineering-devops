# Monitoring in Web Servers

## Why is Monitoring Needed?

Monitoring is essential for:

- **Proactive Issue Detection:** Identifying potential problems before they impact users.
- **Performance Optimization:** Analyzing system behavior to enhance efficiency.
- **Resource Utilization:** Tracking resource usage for effective capacity planning.
- **Security:** Detecting and responding to suspicious activities.

## The Two Main Areas of Monitoring

1. **Performance Monitoring:**
   - Evaluates system health, response times, and resource utilization.
   - Key metrics: CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, and network traffic.

2. **Availability Monitoring:**
   - Ensures that services are accessible and responsive.
   - Involves tracking uptime, downtime, and response status.

## Access Logs for a Web Server (e.g., Nginx)

Access logs record details about every request made to a web server:

- **Information Captured:**
  - IP address of the client.
  - Date and time of the request.
  - HTTP method and requested URL.
  - Response status code.
  - User agent information.

- **Use Cases:**
  - Analyzing traffic patterns.
  - Identifying popular content.
  - Troubleshooting client-specific issues.

## Error Logs for a Web Server (e.g., Nginx)

Error logs document issues encountered by the web server:

- **Information Captured:**
  - Date and time of the error.
  - Error type and severity.
  - Request details leading to the error.
  - Server response to the error.

- **Use Cases:**
  - Diagnosing server errors.
  - Identifying and resolving issues affecting user experience.
  - Monitoring for security-related incidents.
